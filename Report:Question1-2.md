## Part A - https://ittavern.com/troubleshooting-asking-the-right-questions/

The linked article breaks the type of questions we should ask down to the most basic. The "Who, what, when, where" or W questions as stated in the article, provide a general guideline to the issue. Examples would be "What can we do to resolve the issue? What were you doing when the issue happened? Where did the issue occur?". Asking these questions helps give us a better understanding to what the user may have been doing that prompted the issue.

Each of these websites has useful information and tools regarding Windows and Chrome Memory troubleshooting. The First link for PCmag explains how to check for memory problems should any more arise in the future. The Second Link is focused on Chrome specifically as that is the web browser of the user and should be more helpful.
The third link, PCWorld, gives us a more broader sense for general RAM/Memory issues.
