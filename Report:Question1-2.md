## Part A - https://ittavern.com/troubleshooting-asking-the-right-questions/

The linked article breaks the type of questions we should ask down to the most basic. The "Who, what, when, where" or W questions as stated in the article, provide a general guideline to the issue. Examples would be "What can we do to resolve the issue? What were you doing when the issue happened? Where can I find information to stop similar issues from happening?". Asking these questions helps give us a better understanding to what the user may have been doing that prompted the issue.
